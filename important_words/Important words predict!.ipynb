While prices for the bellwether cryptocurrency more than doubled to levels of around $65,000 between early January and mid-April 2021, driven by higher institutional interest, prices fell back to levels of just under $30,000 as of mid-July, due to China’s crackdown on Bitcoin trading and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s increasingly hawkish stance. However, the currency has recovered swiftly from the recent lows, rising by about 65% since July 20th, and trades at about $50,000 currently. The recent recovery is apparently driven by factors including short covering, as well as signs that the U.S. SEC was increasingly open to allowing Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.\n",

Moreover, the U.S. Federal Reserve has turned increasingly hawkish following its mid-June meeting indicating that it could start hiking interest rates from 2023, rather than 2024.

    "doc5 = \"\"\"[indianexpress.com.] August 23, 2021 7:27:38 pm Written by Anubha Gupta Occupying the presidential palace in Kabul, the triumphant Taliban leaders with bazookas in their hands proclaimed that “War has ended in Afghanistan”. Yet, from all around Afghanistan, we see images of anxiety, desperation, chaos, and fear. Winter has finally arrived in Afghanistan. The situation demands grappling with some serious questions: How has the Taliban regained territorial control over Afghanistan? How has the Taliban managed to be so strong, notwithstanding efforts by America to bring it down? What has made this possible? Among many causal explanations, the geopolitical economy of opium can be traced as a plausible factor that led to the Taliban’s victory. Post industrialisation, many political geographers including Mackinder and Spykman established the relationship among space, resources, and politics. There is an interrelationship between resources and war. A resource war is “an armed conflict in which the control and revenue of natural resources are significantly involved in the economy of the conflict or the motivations of the belligerents”. In the 1990s, there were many key resources involved in the war economy — cocaine in Columbia, diamond in DR Congo, oil in Algeria, etc. A variety of actors, from local entrepreneurs and international brokers to global contraband networks and major transnational corporations are involved in the resource war. At every stage in the tragic history of wars in Afghanistan — the Great Game, the covert war of the 1980s, the civil war of the 1990s, and the protracted war post-9/11 — opium has played a central role in shaping the country’s destiny. Opium cultivation was minimal in Afghanistan before the Great Game. The commercialisation of opium started with the coming of the British. It was during the Cold War that a full-blown impetus was provided to the cultivation of opium by the US, which backed the mujahideen to expel the Soviet Union. The Central Intelligence Agency, for the next 10 years, provided the mujahid guerrillas with an estimated $3 billion in arms. The reason most cited for the success of the US in expelling the USSR from Afghanistan is the willy-nilly continuation of drug trafficking by US-backed mujahids. During the 1980s, the Afghan-Pakistan border was converted into a springboard for the international heroin trade. The US state department reported in 1986 that in tribal areas “there is no police force. There are no courts. There is no taxation. No weapon is illegal, hashish and opium are often on display.” Soon, the region became the world’s largest heroin producer. Today, Afghanistan has become the world’s first true narco-state – a country where illicit drugs define political choices, dominate the economy, and determine the fate of foreign interventions. After capturing Kabul in 1996, the Taliban encouraged local opium cultivation by offering government protection to the export trade and also collecting much-needed taxes. The United Nations’ opium surveys showed that during the Taliban’s first three years in power, Afghanistan’s opium crop accounted for 75 per cent of world production. In a war-ravaged Afghanistan, opium fields were a blessing in disguise for the poor as its cultivation required nine times more labour than Afghanistan’s staple crop, wheat. Thus, opium has been intricately woven into the fabric of conflict in Afghanistan. Being a distant decentralised resource, it became an essential part of the local economy, which was then controlled by a new class of warlords. Post 9/11, America only targeted the guerrillas and not the drugs, thus sowing the seeds for the revival of the Taliban. Afghan heroin is trafficked to many destinations worldwide. Europe is the largest market for Afghan heroin. South-East Asia has also become a significant destination. In the past few years, Africa has also received Afghan heroin flows and is becoming a cost-effective trafficking route to North America, Europe and island countries. The opium trade has a network of people from farmers and makeshift lab operators to businessmen working through intermediaries and MNCs. Helmand is the biggest opium-producing province in Afghanistan. In a map released by the UN in October 2015, the revived Taliban was reported to be most active and threatening in Helmand province. A UN Security Council investigation found that the Taliban had systematically tapped “into the supply chain at each stage of the narcotics trade”. According to the New York Times, it “has become difficult to distinguish the group from a dedicated drug cartel”. It was also reported that opium is supplying 60 per cent of the Taliban’s funds for weapons and wages. This significant illegal commodity was then accorded secrecy from fields to foreign markets, inducing corruption. The Afghan war has been a prolonged resource war riding on the back of illicit abundant opium cultivation in the hinterland by the local warlords. Opium has shaped the nature and course of the war over the years. Thus, the future of Afghanistan and its transition to peace will be decided by the very same opium.

    "doc6 = \"\"\"Heroin production has boomed in Afghanistan in recent years, helping fund the Taliban, and experts say they will struggle to wean themselves off the profitable trade despite their promise to do so. Speaking at its first press conference since taking power this week, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid promised that the new government would not turn the world’s leading producer of opium into a fully-fledged narcostate. “We are assuring our countrymen and women and the international community, we will not have any narcotics produced,” Mujahid told reporters in Kabul. “From now on, nobody’s going to get involved [in the heroin trade], nobody can be involved in drug smuggling.” It may take some doing, especially if the new government does not have the same access to financial reserves and foreign aid that have sustained Afghanistan’s fragile economy for two decades. Some major donors have already halted support for the country, one of the world’s poorest, including the IMF which on Wednesday announced it would freeze aid to the country amid uncertainty over recognition of the government. Taliban seized US military biometric devices, report says In 2020, aid flows represented 42.9 per cent of Afghanistan’s US$19.8 billion GDP, according to World Bank data. Beyond cash on hand, the Taliban has few other funds to draw upon – most of the country’s reserves are held overseas. The United States this week froze roughly US$9 billion in assets belonging to Da Afghan Bank, or DAB, the nation’s central bank. About US$7 billion of that is with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, according to DAB’s top official, Ajmal Ahmady, who fled the capital Kabul as it fell to the Taliban. The Biden administration has also stopped shipments of cash. The Taliban remains on the US Treasury’s sanctions designation list. The vast majority of the world’s opium and heroin comes from Afghanistan, with production and exports centred in areas controlled by the Taliban, which has taxed the drugs heavily during their 20-year insurgency. It has become a key resource for the group and they could struggle to ban it, said Jonathan Goodhand, an expert in the international drugs trade at SOAS University of London. “Drugs will bring out a set of tensions in the movement,” he predicted. On one hand, “they want to create this image of themselves as more moderate and more open to engagement with the West and they realise drugs is one of way of doing this,” he said. But on the other, any repression would hit farmers in the Taliban political heartlands of Helmand and Kandahar provinces in particular. The Afghanistan images that could tarnish Joe Biden’s legacy “It’s going to struggle to take a very aggressive approach to drugs,” he added. UN officials reported that the Taliban likely earned more than US$400 million between 2018 and 2019 from the drug trade. A May 2021 US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan (SIGAR) report quoted a US official as estimating they derive up to 60 per cent of their annual revenue from illicit narcotics. Extortion of businesses as well as ransom from kidnapping also provide income, according to a 2020 report from a UN Security Council sanctions committee, which estimated the group’s revenues at $300 million to US$1.5 billion a year. In his premier press conference, Mujahid pleaded for “international assistance” to provide farmers with alternative crops to poppies, the source of sap that is refined into morphine and heroin. The appeal for international aid might prompt hollow laughs from people who worked in the coalition of Nato forces, NGOs and UN workers over the last 10 years that tried in vain to break Afghanistan’s reliance on poppy farming. The United States spent around US$8.6 billion from 2002 to 2017 in its doomed effort to combat the drugs trade, according to a 2018 SIGAR report. Those efforts included paying farmers to grow wheat or saffron, investing in transport links, as well as spraying defoliants on crops and bombing refining facilities. As Taliban takes over, some swap AK-47s for US-made rifles At each step, they found themselves thwarted by Taliban fighters who controlled the main poppy-growing regions and derived hundreds of millions of dollars from the industry, according to US and Afghan government estimates. Farmers in Taliban-controlled areas would often come under pressure to plant poppies from local warlords and fighters, investigations have found. As a result, the country has a near-monopoly on opium and heroin, accounting for 80 to 90 per cent of global output, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). The amount of land planted with poppies hit a record high in 2017 and has averaged around 250,000 hectares in the last four years, roughly four times the level of the mid-1990s, UN figures show. The narcotics policy of the new government will affect global heroin prices, with repercussions for Western countries and their addicts, as well as Russia, Iran, Pakistan and China – all major smuggling routes but also huge markets for Afghan drugs. In recent years, traffickers have also discovered that a plant commonly found in Afghanistan called ephedra can be used to create a key component of methamphetamine, better known as “crystal meth”. Still, spokesman Mujahid vowed Afghanistan would be a “narcotics-free country” moving forward. It’s not the first time the fundamentalist group has vowed to outlaw the trade. Production was banned in 2000, just before the group was overthrown by US-led forces. Profits and poppies: Afghanistan’s illegal drug trade a boon for Taliban Gretchen Peters, the American author of the book Seeds of Terror: How Heroin Is Bankrolling the Taliban and Al-Qaeda , said the Taliban’s previous ban on poppy cultivation was tactical. “They were under immense international pressure,” she said. “It was a ploy because they had so much stored up. They made a huge amount of money once the price shot up by 10 times.” “They are not going to get rid of the drug trade because they are too tied up with it.” “Afghanistan cannot survive without opium. It is simultaneously killing Afghanistan while also keeping a huge number of people alive,” she said, referring to the income the industry provides to poor farmers. Being in control of the country will offer the Taliban access to airlines, the state bureaucracy and banks which could be used to facilitate drug smuggling and money laundering, she explained. “I have no doubt they will exploit it.” Additional reporting by Reuters and Bloomberg\"\"\""
